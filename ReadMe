 * Project ShellConsole (Program.cs) is the entry point of this solution - Main Driver class.
 
 * This Project is developed using Visual Studio Community 2017 for Mac Version 7.1 (build 1297)
 
 * Target Framework on all Projects is selected as - Dot Net Framework 4.5
 
 * The ShellConsole project consumes a ClassLibrary project- HelloWorldClassLibrary included in the solution.
 
 * HelloWorldClassLibrary currently provides methods to read and display data stored in file(config file)
 
 * It can be enhanced in future to read and display data stored in databases, xml or any other data source.
  
 * The library class FileDataModel implements generic interface IDataModel
 
 * The library class FileDataService implements generic interface IDataService
 
 * HelloWorldTestProject is a NUnit test project and has test cases.
  
 * Exception Logging is implemented in the project via log files using LoggingService class in HelloWorldClassLibrary.
  
 * We can dynamically inject the dependency (here IDataModel) and based on its pointing 
   to the classes that implement it it will perform specific operations. 
   
 * By using IDataService reference pointing to FileDataModel we can read data from file,
 
 * By using IDataService reference pointing to XMLDataModel we can read data from  XML file. 
 
 * By using IDataService reference pointing to DBDataModel we can read data from Database.
  
 * And by using Unity Container (Dependency Injection Pattern) 
   we can dynamically inject this dependency into our application
